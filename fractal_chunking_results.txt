whiteboard uh let wait for some people to get in here oh good morning we on subscriber only chat we don need subscriber only chat thank you', 'welcome welcome welcome to my stream hello everybody have chair over here we can sit down not really that visible then we can maybe tilt it down little we re we re going to write on the whiteboard uh let wait for some people to get in here oh good morning we on subscriber only chat we don need subscriber only chat thank you for subscribing this is this setup working we have we have the whiteboard today no computer only whiteboard um you did lot of thinking about the last stream uh did lot of thinking about the uh techno uh pessimism uh argument for the last one it was brought up in few things and we can discuss uh crisis of meaning right maybe you ve heard this phrase who thinks it true right can everyone see the board no one can see the board need to write way bigger um need to write way bigger this is not this is not big enough for the board wow it now understand what you guys always say with the font right all right all right all all right all right we re just going to write the word meaning in big letters right and everybody suffers from this right you think you think oh oh did spell it right yeah meaning right um it not crisis of skill issue right and crisis of meaning is actually incredibly stupid when you think about it like and you know think about it was in new york for the week and thinking about this uh my markers you don like my marker okay we got lots of markers to choose from thank you thank you thank you you know what guys not going to wear black anymore you know always dress in black think going to bleach my hair blonde and going to wear brightly colored clothes not brightly colored but like white you know because it it time the the tides are turning it is it is and the tides are turning you thought that marker was bad this markers is even worse someday they will invent good markers um like big shirts though you know uh no it the other way around bro the fs are white the zeros are black come on um where earth colors no it not about the meaning of life right but you guys know that not kidding when say what is the meaning of life right and there really is only one answer that makes any sense and that to win right that it win no one can see anything this board doesn work it too shiny okay so music um how do you win right so just like like like here we are look around right you are in an open world mmor rpg right here you are with all these people now how do you win at world of warcraft how do you win at zelda right how do you win at wow how do you win at zelda right why do you think it different why and this is what what just comes to me about the crisis of meaning being so incredibly stupid it like have you had crisis of meaning in zelda ever right what am even solving these shrines for you know okay guess it nice guess it nice that you can you can click that button and it says at the top you know destroy calamity genon right going to stop saying right realized say right at the end of things and it bad and not going to do that anymore because it new year it before even though you can see it and it in green marker when it felt real understand that but what do you think feels real anymore go to new york every year and the things that used to feel real don feel real anymore either we can go back we can only go forward only forward not back so you have no problem with this objective in world of warcraft in zelda and there lots of different things you can do in these games you can you can join guild you can go gather mushrooms in the forests uh but it it you don have crisis of meaning in these games and why not why do you have crisis of meaning in this world but not there sorry sorry the game is hard sorry the game takes really long time to beat can tell you how to quit procrastination just the the world okay can everybody harvard can everybody read this cuz we re going to put big no sign through it these people have led us wrong for the last years for the last years we ve been listening to idiot ot we don have to listen to them anymore harvard over we re free um no we don we don there has been group of people since since we ll put the year up here since that has been you know this the year the money became fake this is when everything seemed to go and we just don have to listen to them anymore are can draw my best integral sign go you re the reason we re going to go subscriber only uh no no no no don trust see but this is the problem now okay so we destroy harvard right everyone everyone everyone loves being who is it robes pierre everyone loves being the guy who going to you know storm the bastial and kill the nobles but the question is what do we replace it with you you can replace this with bunch of hack conspir iracy theories and libertarianism and and and whatever you can do that you need to come up with new uh epistemology sort of mean not really like it it been there the whole time it been there the whole time and it brings me back to this point which is how do we win so you ve played you ve played breath of the wild right some of you have you know when you re on that little island with the four you get the four shrines and and uh you get the four shrines and then you get your parag glider and you can leave the little island look at the universe we haven even left the little island yet here here here is here is earth earth right and here the sun over here right and like space is like we ll make it little bigger cuz it the sun right and like space is like mad big guys um to be fair there not going to be beautiful little quests in every corner of space this game is harder than that reality is hard game it not not to scale not to scale all right not to scale okay so we re going to talk about got few uh it name is soul okay fine fine fine fine fine soul soul soul soul that that that like the that like the name we ll put alpha centor over here is that is that alpha alpha cantor goes over here don know how to spell that but you know it like like like isn that kane new girl sentory sensory something like that um not to scale music uh it it not it not it not appreciate so let talk about few ways that technology is actually going to start to improve your life again um so for the just listened to jim rutz cory doo for the tech was synonymous with this group called fang okay uh most of these companies are not technology companies and if they do technology it is mostly kind of as an aside right like there some interesting stuff happening at meta interesting stuff happening at apple interesting stuff happening at google amazon logistics company netflix is stated media company um but this is not technology and you shouldn associate that uh when you think technology the best thing to think about is farming right you guys watch you know what cool clarkson farm this is clarkson farm farming is the best thing to think about because humans have been growing food for many many many years and oh man if those if those if those first agricultural guys who were trying to get like mule to pull plow saw tractor oh they flip the man yo big tractor coming through the field you know tilling all the soil planting all the seeds right chopping all the wheat man they flip so can anybody sit right here now and say that things have not gotten better and yeah there some there some great like like crisis of meaning stuff oh things used to have meaning you used to have to rely on your neighbor things used to be better dude if you want things to be better like that leave america you could you could go you know love watching these this is this is youtube our best documentaries and you watch africa documentaries love africa documentaries you can see right now if you want to go live in world where people still need each other and food hard to get and there sense of community and tribalism you can go to africa and live this life right if you want to said right got to stop doing that um but like do you want to be you can out you can opt out at any point the lites can opt out but for most people come on let be real here do you want to be pulling the plow or do you want the tractor um don want to rely on yeah it true it true like something lost right and no technology guy not philosophy guy you know and it shame that philosophy guys all came from you know terrible institutions like this there are smart ways to think about philosophy you just don see much of them there are there is real liberal arts education out there but unfortunately we are lost generation unfortunately for the last years what has been called liberal art is nothing of the sort what you will get in liberal art you know hey ho hey ho western culture got to go come on right and it it not it hasn gone anywhere it still there you can still find it there people out there and love when meet them people out there who are still incredibly educated on the humanities but these these these these neo marxists like you know ve met some smart marxists ve met some smart marxists and you can you can talk about marx um in in in smart ways and it is true that they still do produce some decent marxists but don think marxism is really the future think that it had some good points while ago we tried it and hey you know we got the soviet union uh all right markx was jew so what what streaming what music up what up got you got co yeah oh all right uh streaming you bring me uh yeah yeah uh yeah should be good be uh no don think it co oh yeah the flu is just whatever the flu is just whatever uh happens to be the uh the the the thing uh that goes around we call it the flu we call it cold we call it whatever coron virus is cold uh okay don have cod um let not get distracted by that we we got distracted let let let go back to where we were so yeah there there is real liberal arts education out there and hope some of you you know all you people who comment you realize the internet commenters always remember that the internet commenters are very small subset of society oh was commenting about your marks as so what man come on let move past racism it and we can all agree that racism especially uh systemic racism like affirmative action systematic systemic with the system does it like affirmative action is evil and there no place for racism going forward so let let let stop doing that right um and if you re not on board with the no racism you can maybe go to harvard think they like racism there so you know maybe he ll fit in hey maybe you ll fit in um jees hate what come on stop with the racist like it still racist it doesn matter it all white power black power wokeism it all racist racism is stupid okay you want to win or not you know even even even link had to work with the with those fish people yeah you had to work with the fish people all right all right imagine he was racist against fish stop being racist right can everyone can everyone stop being racist in that good come in oh know my door get stuck we re telling everybody that there no room for racism in you need well help yourself hold yourself to my pile of money um have some in my wallet too think we re on to stream right now you need this money right now what is like like like tony spr stopping by he going to shake us down he is one is there right now all right got got some here where have you been going no just every time get dollars put them in the pile over there you want you you want to show them my dollars that is insane oh here some dollars what is happening what here you want some dollars got dollars you likey to me about your activities how upset will you be if make it rain right now wait wouldn be upset ll pick it all up you ll pick it up yeah make it laughter rain mean have to feel bad for the guy has to count it all he going to think came stripper always remember that we re having more fun than the other side right cells having no fun have fun uh no it it true though it true ve learned this ve learned this from from protests right like you look protests you know like the leftist protest used to have the energy and who ever got the energy but can we have protest where we we stop like don know you know what you know what infuriated me last night watched that video about housing in japan and it turns out we really are just all getting scanmed like there no reason housing should be expensive this is deliberate policy made up by people who own real estate to make their real estate bag stay expensive it just scam uh and like you all are affected by this scam my my red for this apartment is that insane get this in toal too for grand no um tokyo is expensive sorry if you re homeowner but your bags are going to tank bro get out get out while you can no legit if you are in this scam get out today warning you right now michael bur tweeting it yo man uh you guys know michael bur is right um now not saying you got to do protests saying you got to be with the energist who ever having good time wins the future and who ever having bad time loses the future uh wait no but the housing market actually going to crash it just question of when perception is reality until it not and the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent but not me so you know want to print mrna at home too that right music um you ve heard this for decades now yes but let me tell you what is different this time okay there is one thing that changes does anyone know what that one thing is not bitcoin technology okay what does it take to build house what if we just had machine that could print houses it like there great think it it haak quote at the end of the uh you know the wpf happen in page um that says the only way that we re ever going to make money real again is if we figure out how to make it something that they can quite see as money sorry they see bitcoin as money crypto failed okay now that doesn mean that technology is going to fail but this this this this like oh we re going to get crypto in before they notice sorry no like imagine uber took the path that bitcoin took right uber worked uber exists today because it turned out that all the congressmen were taking ubers to go to congress the congressmen are not using bitcoin to buy coffees and they don give about crypto and until crypto people understand this until crypto people understand how to make normal people depend on their thing there no future in crypto okay say this all the time like you want to succeed in crypto stop trying to make zk snark and make triangle it like square but you can pay decentralized with crypto right and you know you can there lot of think there actually lot of energy like this in new york love in new york you pay for everything with cash it works right you know and they all have they all have signs that say fee for credit cards love that mean you have to pass that on to the consumer the consumer has to feel the pain of those merchant fees um check out doo no uh yeah yeah you streames yeah this is this is this is this is unfortunate but this is what your bags and housing are going to look like if you don get out and this is what your money is going to look like if you are socialists oh no this is india democracy yeah that what happens if you do democracy um someone someone was angry on my last video saying embrace fascists who peter teal who the fascist man it crazy to me that like man you want to like give people freedom and make things cheap that fascist man you can just do that right like we need like one world government and surveillance state so we can save democracy yeah laughter right um we don need another war can we do this without war come on world war is actually going to suck guys like you think it going to be cool and you think it going to be some call of duty but like it not okay it just going to suck um everyone inist now uh how many houses does my family own yo inheritance tax who on board you got to build you got to build yourself up uh war is kind of essential not not an anti war not proar uh think that war is appropriate in certain circumstances um uh world war iii mean love cold wars cold wars are the best cold wars are the best possible outcome of wars nobody dies and technology gets better love the us china cold war maybe we can have ai skirmishes where drones destroy each other over the pacific ocean now that my kind of war right we can get behind that now warm wars soft and the kind that the worst kind of war like world war ii was awful okay and the worst kind of war is war that wants to get the citizenry involved right like total war where your citizenry have to contribute to the stupid war effort sucks okay none of us want to live through that uh nice uh war between us and china where we like fight over some uninhabited island to just like tech pissing contest that sounds sick man like that the kind of war we want in the future okay it not like nice war right it it it an understanding that both sides could nuke each other and turn everybody into rubble right we sort of do this with proxy wars it little upsetting that people still have to die imagine we had proxy wars where we just sent robots and we can all agree to some geneva convention where we all just send robots to war and anyone who sends people to war is terrorist how about that um tech bro wants war no do do want that kind of war though think every year we should have uh drone combat with china over uh to take control of an uninhabited island rules you can send people and maybe there no there doesn have to be budget cap it like the olympic games but with technology think that be sick that huge waste of resources bro bro what are we gonna do help poor people in somalia come on come on drone war sounds sick george you can do that that fascist okay well that like your opinion man that that that that my new phrase for like like that like your opinion man think it from the big lowski think it good war on the moon let go right the thing about the moon is almost everything you do to it improves the place you explode nuclear bomb on the moon bet you it gets better have seen for all mankind no what that is that like seven jeans true religion uh space race except you can shoot at other spaceships no no no no let have the pvp zones of space and the pve zones of space saying that about crypto right like we like that that be cool uh no no no did like curtis think about look but um you know think uh we re we re we re going to compliment mark andreon think think mark andreon uh does bring up really good point about these sort of radical uh radical uh lites and if they really believe that this technology is going to destroy the world if you re going to destroy the world and you think you know if you really think that your neighbor is working on project that going to destroy the world killing your neighbor is the right thing to do right and they re going to become violent um you know hopefully not hopefully they see the light before they do but think this is one of the smartest things andreon said and it is uh sadly something we have to watch out for but the good news is we have drones and they do not um um am christian uh look guys all right um can believe was duped into atheism but also evolution is real so yeah like christianity could see do sort of see bit of resurgence of christianity among uh younger people christian believe in evolution uh my belief in evolution does come above my christianity right so so if you say you can you know if you say jesus didn die for your sins if you believe in evolution well that like your opinion man uh so but no when it comes down to lot of the again wokeism really showed me the importance of christianity and the importance of forgiveness wokeism is original sin without forgiveness uh and we can have that we have original sin but we have foress okay that christianity like it want you to get on board it nice religion we love everybody come to church uh don know church is kind of boring someone got to make cool churches actually the churches in the south are cool if if uh if lived in the south by like one of them like like sea coast church in south carolina uh and it was good and probably go every sunday uh you know the the the the lowbudget catholic church doesn doesn doesn draw me in every weekend not not hating just doesn draw me in every weekend uh the rock bands are cool right like think this is good think that like all right fine they finally caught up to the but would love to see resurgence of the church uh that church that embraces technology because if you do not embrace technology you will lose how do you how do these people who say they don like tech like do they have sustainable plan for the future do do they have like like have they thought about what the future is going to look like people who don like tech are like conservatives uh conservatives we re going to rip on conservatives everybody knows conservatives suck uh the kind of conservatives who like in the really didn like gay marriage and today they really don like trans people right but gay marriage is fine and then in years well trans people are fine but we have to do something about pedophiles right like like like like it going to be these conservatives are always losing because they have no principles it just backlash backlash to the backlash to the thing that just beun right so don uh don be conservative don be lite unless you like losing who the worst who the worst football team in the nfl was saying this was saying this to to friend yesterday uh you know there some people who just got to stop saying you know and got to stop saying right self aware about this stuff right you know uh the jets aren pedos always bet don like pedos but like again oh don want to get into this come on let let let ah let let let let let not get into this but think there is destination of where this stuff goes and just culture war stupid the culture war stupid there only one war that matters and that are you on the side of technology or you against technology this is the new dividing line this is the new dividing line in society we don have uh conservatives and liberals anymore we have excel and cel okay cel and excel and which side are you on are you on this side or are you on this side now this side is conservative so we ll give him right and this side is progressive we give him and if you ve been listening to the last five minutes you realize that the always lose and the always win so do you want to root for the oakland raiders or do you want to root for the patriots when they still had tom brady look it right so it is kind of still conservatives and and and liberals but this is really the dividing line now look in embracing technology does not mean embracing every single piece of every single technology and it all good even if there negative effects that not what it means that not what it means think the most pure way to distill this down and every metric can still be perverted every metric can be perverted good heart law but think the most pure way to look at it is energy use this is energy use up and this is energy use minus do we want to use more energy in the future or do we want to use less energy in the future right humans population do we want there to be more humans in the future or less humans in the future some people might put plus there and still be conservatives but really it all the same thing energy use in humans what the difference humans use lot of energy well you can use the energy for that no right are you progressive or or are you conservative and there people out there who are conservatives and don mean to hate on the individual who conservative the conservative who wants to be left alone and live their own lifestyle we need to totally respect that totally respect the person who doesn want to allow the new technology into their lives and that fine you can and you should you should be left alone and that the moral duty of these people the moral duty of these people is to people who want to be left alone people who don want the technology to come for them it absolutely should not for them people should totally be able to opt out of this otherwise you re just asking for fight uh and think that real think that mistake that the uh current progress has made uh so if you want to opt out you can opt out what you cannot do is prevent this if you re on this side and you want to exist that fine but if you re on this side and you want to try to stop this that where we have problem and these are the people who need to be soundly defeated in every pole in every ballot in every democracy in every war in every everything war is the fundamental decider we don doesn have to come to war let hope it doesn have to come to war let hope these people realize that if you don embrace technology you lose and you don even have to fight now let give them good surrender terms let them surrender peacefully let them live out life on their farm let them reproduce right this is this is animal conservation it the same thing right we like animal conservation we re progressives all right so everybody in welcome to the progressive team welcome to the accelerationist team we love technology we want to see more humans we want to see flourishing we don want to see deceleration we don want to see housing not being built we don want to see power plants being knocked down we don want to see uh one child policies we don see anything that looks like that it negative it negative got got positive energy over here see not dressing in black anymore it time it time the future is ours is this is this just is this just me with the same same accelerationist andreon manifesto we come on uh so coming back to here coming back to meaning um look what is the existentialism of the st century don know not that great at liberal arts not uh good pr good security guy not like the stuff hobbyist but when meet people who are genuinely good at this stuff the people who know like all of all of the the sar books and the kimu books the people who ve actually read like like being in time and are like understand it what what was on my book what uh oh critique of pure reason like the people who ve actually read critique of pure reason just can do it but but there people out there who have and this is this is serious role in the future for this figure out what the existentialism of the st century is don know don know but there answers here and the closest can come is thinking about winning and don mean winning over other people mean winning over nature we are in this great open world universe and do we want to win or lose let win you could stand in the same place you could you could play zelda you could just stand there but why would we do that you could play your little you could play your little mini game you could go around catch horses by that one stable all day but why would we do that let progress let get to the end of the game we re going to be tired of winning we re going to win so much going to be tired of winning jesus trump in what what sad what sad state but it doesn matter it doesn matter this is the new line this is the new line um you re either on this team or you re on this team right no racism okay don see any racism if you want to be racist go to harvard okay they re they got to they got let them let them have racism and you know they can they can be stuck in and and you know let him have racism um charlie she was ahead of his time uh harvard is is racist yes yes they are they are um they have they they so so look let just come up with very simple definition of racism if you are looking at people race if you are making decisions based on people race you are racist pretty straightforward right so if harvard looks at people race when they decide who to admit they are racist and because harvard is powerful corporation that systemic racism okay should should teach should teach impression studies does everyone like this systemic racism when government or large corporation uses race to discriminate systemic racism um is doctor racist then well doctor doesn use that to discriminate right if doctor were to look at someone race and charge them different amount based on their race sure if if you you race affects your medical yeah but come on we live in society we live in christian society where we re all equal under god okay everybody has the same moral value to god now that doesn mean that everyone going to have the same stuff that just that just the economy that just we live in free world you make you make choices you you have free will you also unfortunately are somewhat trapped to your genetics but that just life sometime the ball comes up red sometime the ball comes up black should we make roulette illegal no but we should remove the zeros from the wheels one zero is plenty three zeros is really egregious and someone needs to do something about this um is all racism bad think so okay now do think uh race does correlate with certain things that you may want to discriminate based on you may want to discriminate based on uh culture you may want to live pe uh live around people who have similar values to you this is all very different and this is not racism um racism is literally racism is asking the question what race are you this is not real category this is it it it it singles out few pieces of dna that that that don your color your skin come on man this is we are progressives here we have moved past this okay racism is over it back at harvard um how do we build the protech future mean it not going to be easy and it not going to happen overnight there going to be big struggle okay so let get let move past racism is stupid topic uh let move to good topic okay housing right um this is peter chals thesis and ve come to believe that it very true if we can fix housing we can fix lot of other problems in society so housing you basically have two groups you have land owners and then the uh renters in this class so we have two classes now let say rent were to come down the renters would be happy but the landowner class the homeowner class would be unhappy their bads would become smaller look you got to give them way out you got to give them way out don know what that going to be yet hope people smarter than me or at least thinking about this more than me are are are working on this cuz you do have to give them bag out but this is what needs to happen you re going to get continued very strong opposition from this class this is why this won happen but if we figure out how to either saer swindle whatever it is we do to this class don know you know all for all for diplomatic solutions here but something got to be done right this is class warfare this is marxism one you know they really try to distract you with racist but we are the boys we are the and something got to be done about the damn land owners gouging everybody because they don just gouge everybody by charging lot for their properties they vote in elections and then they make it illegal to build more housing basic hope everyone understands this now and hope everyone sees that it doesn have to be this way think the simplest way to get people out of this and into this is to show them that the future fut can be better than the present if you live in world where we re in pretty much decline since it hard for them to believe that the future can be better than the present look at look up look up trust in the us government look up trust in the us government peak to kennedy and it gone downhill since little spike at reagan little spike at clinton but mostly it gone downhill since we need to convince people things can be better and they can thanks to technology because everyone can agree that tractor is lot better than plowing the field yourself uh so eat the rich love it love it let team up with aoc we got to get aoc on this team right we got to how do we get aoc on this team we can do it cuz these are the good guys uh know uncle ted wouldn agree but like it not good it not good we got to move past that we got to move past that ridiculous way of thinking that somehow meaning is being stripped from the world all right let talk about let talk about let talk about ted kazinski right guy loved nature wild nature guy did not like uniform housing projects don like uniform housing projects either the things that we can build in the future look more like nature there pirate wires article about this we can the reason that houses are boring beig boxes is because the manufacturing technologies of the last years allow us to build boring beige boxes as we get control of as we can use additive manufacturing technologies as we can use biotech to build that the look at species that that the future like fusion of of of of biology and the things in the future are going to look more like nature not less like nature we will exist in more harmony with nature with more technology things today are when you think about just want you to imagine an appliance from the and how sketchy it looked the thing was fire hazard the thing was think about like transformer and you re putting things through and your little coils are vibrating at hz and it scraping the enamel off the coils now compare that to mosfet think about it think about beautiful little tiny mosfet switching kilowatt you can switch kilowatt with mosfet you know volts amps is kilowatt with mosfet moset symbol we ll draw the transistor compare this this is also not to scale compare this to oh what got to build relay what am going to do build to relay and like pull magnet on here and then have like little like electromagnetic coil here oh oh the solid state it it the technology gets us closer to like beautiful pure things um the relay and the transformer last way shorter amount of time know that not mosfet what the mosfet what the mosfet symbol well you know what going to label them gate drain and source so therefore it is mosat there we go take that electrical engineering um actually this is it this right the drain is the emitter the source is the collector don know uh is that right uh mean think yeah because usually drain is like if you have like um it depends think it depends if it type or ptype um yeah we could go into uh but but it but it this stuff was watching uh you watch super bowl from uh from from you watch like the the super bowl uh show and you look at these large hallogen lamps that you can switch on and off quickly how would you even do that how would you even switch it on and off quickly today we have leds switched by mosfets come on that cool um so drain source and drain it gate source and drain are the three things but forget whatever it this npn because dre the eror that way pnp is the other way don know come from prosat um uh small transistor uses less energy out arrow is end type yeah okay uh mosfet and heat sink yeah but you need you need tinier heat sink today you need tinier heat sink today than you do in the past because your so mosfet has resistance here you you have you have some you have some basic like like the model is that it semiconductor with some resistance actually this resistance that matters so you have some uh drain source resistance when your mosfet fully saturated and these things are becoming this like it think it beyond efficient today meaning that for every for every you want to switch kilowatt you only need to sync watts bet they re even more bet they re even more than efficient today um if we had computers we could look this stuff up but the future is so bright agree uh so this is separate problem and we need real liberal arts majors to work on this we need people who actually understand like what what was called the liberal arts for many many years till it was perverted by marxist cult right is this is this controversial think think everyone kind of gets it now um what can us as engineers do okay stop and say the same thing always say think about what you re working on and what the convergent end point of it is think about where your technology is going and how your technology is going to change the world what group of people is it going to benefit is it going to benefit if you are at physics research lab researching mosfets with low drain source resistance you were doing good for the world if you are working on uh you know uh uh you know we don have even have to give examples you know you know the kind of things that talking about if if you are working on if you work at turbo tax and you are lobbying the irs to make the tax code more complicated that my favorite example but there many forms of that if you are working to slow down any of this technology if you were the person who made elon strap seal to board you re the bad guy so what can you as engineers do mean think about who you work for do you work for people who look like this or do you work for people who look like this lot of these sort of people still want technology the new york times has somebody making their website don do that the new york times actually isn that bad but you know you know the ones who are bad um if if there not if the the the the ownership of your company is fundamentally against technology stop working for them and start working for people who like technology and want the future to be better than the present uh yeah fang and john deere are probably on the left side of the board uh mean think don look don know that much about john deere uh for fang companies yeah mean wouldn work at google uh think think google is is fairly anti technology today think that um it less clear for company like amazon uh of course they rely on tech and look just like just like welcome to the you know welcome to the welcome to the welcome to the the lit where we used to come people used to quit because they re they re you know oh my company doesn support like uh my company isn pro choice going to quit the company right that right you know respect these people right to to stand up for what they believe in and all the engineers out there you know stand up for what you believe in right it the same thing uh but think uh you know it it it if if your if your company doesn share pro technology set of values stop working there stop helping them with technology um meta is these companies are large they have many different divisions they have many different teams think that can promise that all of my interactions with elon match up to what you think elon is elon seems to be complet like there no there actually isn filter how elon behaves is what elon is can say the same thing about mark zuckerberg or jeff bezos not sure not saying that they re not but what saying is it not completely obvious to me and see if you can find somebody who would vouch for uh them you know someone who someone who someone who spent time close with mark zuckerberg does he actually believe the kind of stuff he saying now uh and then there also question of do these people have you look at someone like jack dorsy in twitter it turns out jack dorsy was just cut out of everything in twitter so sometimes you might even have the question is do they have control and do they have good values uh so come on we all learned we all learned from the sjws in the some of their tactics are good some of their tactics are good don announce them because they re sjw tactics but always make sure that you are having fun and if you re not having fun you re going to lose right if you if you see this all as drudgery and this is what said on twitter like if you don love technology quit technology right it going to be party and that the kind of energy that was loved occupy wall street back in the day that the kind of energy that that that that that works that sustainable everyone here is having good time building the future ah what the name of this cult it not cult man it the future it the progressivism it progressivism right progressivism we believe in in progress we boogieing right electric boogaloo the booo boys see they having good time man um how is xcel the good side if the doomers are right what are the doomers right about everybody can say ai and they can say doom okay what exactly how exactly does ai lead to doom was trying to get owski to explain it and it just like converging endpoint you know what elsea convergent endpoint is the heat death of the universe okay the heat death of the universe is coming and if we have any chance of answering the last question we need ai so currently we are on trajectory to doom want everybody to remember that you know some people have those clocks that like how long you have in your lifespan well how long do we have before the heat death of the universe right right got to stop saying that got to stop saying that got to stop my verbal ticks it uh think it more than few billion years but the heat death of the universe is coming and in order to beat the heat death of the universe we need we need ai maybe maybe you can beat the heat death of the universe we don really know ai leads to doom when the government uses autonomous robocop with all technology there challenges with every technology in the past with all this new surveillance technology that now exists there are challenges is ai pure unalloyed good no is technology pure unalloyed good when you have gun pointed at your head you do not think technology is pure unalloyed good but on balance is technology good and the answer is think obviously with things like hvac and cheap food and cars and look like flew just flew on jet blue from new york right could talk about jet blue but imagine flying in that like right flyer twoo at least that was on was on um against progress of technology they no longer provide benefits no that not true we are unfortunately like you ve been scammed by group of people for the last years the reason things have gotten worse is largely not because of technology also just listened to corey docto on on uh on uh think jim rut podcast and like we have been scammed largely through government inaction against these tech companies still someone in the comments like george you don even know you can download other browsers for ios just when someone says something like that want you to think want you to think do not know how browsers work on ios or are you wrong when you download chrome on ios it uses web view which is actually just safari because nothing else on ios is allowed to mark pages rwx rwx is permission built into the kernel that only the jits allowed to bypass there is chance out of date on that information but don think so okay so you think who you talking to right um we went from world where microsoft couldn bundle internet explorer with uh windows without getting sued and now we live in world where apple not only bundles safari but doesn let you install anything else so this is not due to technology this is due to failure of government this is due to regulatory capture technology itself when you think of technology don think of fang think of moset very simplistic model of moset you put in little current here and massive currents flow here it switch and that has changed that why everything so small and good now you have phone that can charge got got my phone charger around here watts putting watts into something this big you think you can do that without mos fats you can use transformer so everybody don think of fang when you think of technology think of the mosat all right it for ios not for the mac yeah for the mac you actually can install different web browsers thank you for watching today stream it the end of uh make sure you re having good time if you re not having good time if you re if you re if you re angry you re probably over here and might consider switching to the you know what the stands for it stands for party you re joining you re joining the party side happy for everybody have great new year unalloyed tech optimism someone got to solve this someone got to solve this let let let create an alternative to this that can produce real liberal art scholars who can solve the meaning crisis not smart enough to come up with it but smart enough to read it and understand it so would appreciate that uh if you were out there uh happy new year everybody', 'welcome welcome welcome to my stream hello everybody have chair over here we can sit down not
