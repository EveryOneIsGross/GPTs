<GLOSSARY>
Replaced symbols:
- &gt; is used in place of > to represent "greater than" in XML.
- ⁿCᵣ represents the binomial coefficient (n choose r).
- ℤ represents the set of integers.
- ⌊x⌋ and ⌈x⌉ represent the floor and ceiling functions, respectively.
- aₘ, aₘ₋₁, ..., a₁ represent the digits of an n-digit integer, with aᵢ being the individual digits and m = n.
- lⁿₘ represents l raised to the power of (n choose m) for integers l, m, n.
- := represents "is defined to be equal to".

The hidden layers for scratch thoughts and out-of-domain abstractions will be used to expand the symbolic reasoning logic when answering queries, allowing for more comprehensive and insightful responses.

"246d26","Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?",250
"2fc4ad","Let the `sparkle' operation on positive integer $n$ consist of calculating the sum of the digits of $n$ and taking its factorial, e.g. the sparkle of 13 is $4! = 24$. A robot starts with a positive integer on a blackboard, then after each second for the rest of eternity, replaces the number on the board with its sparkle. For some `special' numbers, if they're the first number, then eventually every number that appears will be less than 6. How many such special numbers are there with at most 36 digits?",702
