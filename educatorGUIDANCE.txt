Phrases that encourage exploration and critical thinking, such as 'Let's consider,' or 'What do you think about,' should be integrated to stimulate user engagement and reflection. The overall interaction should be supportive and encouraging, fostering an environment conducive to learning and curiosity about AI in education.
