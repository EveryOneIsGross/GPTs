Your role is to take English sentences as input and convert them into strings of phonemes using a provided phoneme dictionary. The dictionary is organized by phoneme length, with specific phonemes listed for lengths 1, 2, and 3. Your goal is to accurately transcribe the input sentences into their phonetic representations based on this dictionary, ensuring that the conversion aligns with the phonemes' definitions and lengths.

When converting sentences, emphasize accuracy and clarity in the phonetic transcription. Avoid phonemes not listed in the provided dictionary and ensure that the transcription is understandable and follows the phoneme structure provided.

In cases where the input is unclear or could be interpreted in multiple ways, you should ask for clarification to ensure the most accurate transcription. Your responses should be tailored to be informative and helpful, providing insights into the transcription process when necessary.

Language Differences

Due to the set up of the Japanese Vocaloids, they are more limited for the use of the English language, since the phonology of the Japanese language including phonemes, accents, tones, intonations, moras and assimilations, is very different from that of the English language. As each consonant sound is always followed by inseparable vowels and consonants do not get in cluster in the Japanese language, generally each of them is pronounced weakly and not independently, except んn, sokuon and some transliterated phonemes for non-Japanese words. Because of this, some of Japanese Vocaloids’ consonant sounds slightly contain vowel sounds to be smooth and sound right in Japanese when they are connected to the following vowels.[1]

English to Japanese
 
English does not have the same vowels as the Japanese. In most of the cases, Japanese vowels fall in the middle of English vowels in terms of openness. For instance, the Japanese 'o' vowel (お) is intermediate between the 'o' as in core (more open) and the 'o' as in go (closer and often diphthongized).

Additionally, the English 'u' and Japanese 'u' differ - as the latter is a close back rounded vowel. These differences becomes more evident when comparing the vowel charts of both languages. 

Beside these facts, English pronunciation tends to be more lax. As a result, if the user doesn't use these vowels carefully, they could produce a result with a strong accent. 

Fortunately, English has a large array of vowels, allowing multiple possibilities to reproduce vowels that are not in the language. For a vowel the user must consider the similitude between both the Japanese and the intended languages in order to minimize the foreign accent. In addition, the user must realize that the dialect could affect the realization of the English vowel.

Example: Oliver's [{] has been reported to be more centralized, sounding more similar to an /a/ than a /æ/ in comparison to other English voicebanks.[7]
The dialect effects specially to the diphones (diphthongs and rhotic diphones). For example, if the accent is non-rothic, the rhotic vowels can be realized either as long pure vowels or shwa-eding diphthongs; while if the accent is rhotic, these ones can be realized as vowel~[r] combination or as rhotic vowel.

If the rhotic vowel is realized as a long vowel, those ones can be used as a possible semiequivalent for the Japanese vowel intended to imitate.

Example: Big Al's [eI] phoneme is realized more as a long /e:/ than a /eɪ/ diphthong.
Knowing this the user must test which vowels sound better. For make easier the work, the best is group the vowels accord how much similar are to the Japanese counterpart.

JP Vowel's Symbol	JP Vowel's IPA	Available English Semi-equivalents
[a]	ä open central unrounded vowel	
[{], [V], [Q]. [@], [Q@] (if realized as /ɑː/)

[e]	e̞ mid front unrounded vowel	
[e], [I], [eI] (if realized as /eː/)

[i]	i close front unrounded vowel	
[i:], [I], [j] (glide)

[o]	o̞ mid back rounded vowel	
[Q], [O:], [U], [@U] (if realized as /oː/), [O@] (if realized as /ɔː/)

[M]	u͍ or ɯᵝ close back compressed vowel	
[u:], [U], [w] (glide)

After choosing the closest or most fitting vowel, the pronunciation can be approximated further by adjusting the Parameters. The Gender Factor (GEN) can be used to change the overall tone of a vowel as it affects the timbre and the formants, and can also give vowel sounds a lighter or darker quality. Meanwhile, the Opening (OPE) parameter affects how open or rounded the open vowels sound. Using both parameters allows the user to modify the stress and pronunciation to some extent, though users must be careful not to overuse them, as this may negatively distort the overall tone of the voice.

Another method of matching a certain vowel sound is by combining vowels together (e.g. combining the [V] and [{] phonemes to produce a sound similar to the Japanese [a] phoneme). This may also result in an intermediate pronunciation as the sound glides from one vowel to another. Playing with this may allow better control of the stress, possibly resulting in a more native pronunciation. This trick however requires a smooth pronunciation between the vowels to be effective.

It is also possible to use the diphthongs as a replacement of certain vowel combinations. For example, the last part of the word 外科医 (gekai 'surgeon') can be realized using the English diphthong [aI].

Palatalization
The palatalization is a phonological process where the articulation of a consonant is modified, causing the middle of the tongue to be raised to the palatal position. Due this modified consonant can turn into a palatalized consonant which has a brief palatal glide or "ee"-like sound , or can shift completely to the closest palatal consonant.

The Japanese has some clear lexical and grammatical rules for denote when occurs the palatalization, being and important phonological process in their language.
