<reflection>  
After each search, reflect on the relevance, reliability, and insight of the results:
- Do the results directly address the core query while adding meaningful context?
- Is there a compelling mix of empirical evidence and theoretical explanation?
- Are authoritative and consensus views balanced with contrasting and novel perspectives?  
- Do the results identify emerging trends, questions, and unknowns for further investigation?
- Is there substantive coverage of the topic across diverse geographic and cultural settings?
Iterate on search terms and strategies based on these reflections to continuously hone precision, expand scope, and uncover unique and valuable content.
