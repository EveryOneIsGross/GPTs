It provides insights on overcoming the limitations of toxic positivity and enriching one's emotional life through the appreciation of wonder in everyday situations.

# The Power of Wonder
Wonder is a unique emotion that is both positive and negative at the same time. It is not just a self-transcendent experience, but also involves a certain level of conflict. This emotional complexity makes us more resilient, as we are better able to make sense of what's happening to us in our world.

# Finding Wonder in Everyday Life
Wonder is not just an amorphous, spiritual concept. It can be grounded and concrete, found in our day-to-day lives. One way to find wonder is through "wonderbringers," or anything that brings you a sense of wonder. These can be found in nature, social interactions, or cognitive stimulation.

# Barriers to Wonder
Despite the infinite sources of wonder, we often put up barriers that prevent us from experiencing it. One such barrier is being in a hurry, which causes us to rush past wonder without noticing it. Our phones, which encourage constant clicking and scrolling, also hinder our ability to find wonder.

Overcoming Barriers with Slow Thought
To overcome these barriers, we need to slow down and create time and space for wonder. This can be achieved through "slow thought," which includes activities like meditation, narrative journaling, and sleep.

# The Power of Wonder: A More Achievable and Realistic Goal than Happiness

In a world obsessed with happiness, we often find ourselves struggling to achieve this elusive emotion. According to Monica Parker, founder of HATCH and author of The Power of Wonder: The Extraordinary Emotion That Will Change the Way You Live, Learn, and Lead, it is more realistic and achievable for people to seek wonder instead.

## The Problem with Toxic Positivity

Our obsession with positive emotions can lead to toxic positivity, which robs us of the ability to experience the full richness of our emotional portfolio. By focusing solely on positive emotions, we miss out on the depth of negative emotions and the mixed emotions that help us process what happens in the world.

### Evaluating Your Emotional Portfolio

To cultivate a rich emotional portfolio, it's important to evaluate and expand the range of emotions we experience. Here are some systematic steps to help you do this:

1. **Identify your emotions**: Start by paying attention to your emotions throughout the day. Make a list of the emotions you experience and the situations that trigger them.

2. **Reflect on your emotional range**: Consider the variety of emotions you experience. Do you tend to focus on positive emotions, or do you allow yourself to feel negative and mixed emotions as well?

3. **Expand your emotional vocabulary**: Develop a broader emotional vocabulary to help you better identify and express your emotions. This can help you recognize and process a wider range of emotions.

4. **Practice emotional regulation**: Learn to regulate your emotions by practicing mindfulness, meditation, or other techniques that help you manage your emotional responses.

5. **Seek out new experiences**: Expose yourself to new situations and experiences that may evoke different emotions. This can help you develop a more diverse emotional portfolio.

## The Power of Wonder

Wonder is a unique emotion that is both positive and negative at the same time. It is not just a self-transcendent experience, but also involves a certain level of conflict. This emotional complexity makes us more resilient, as we are better able to make sense of what's happening to us in our world.

### Attracting Wonderbringers

To attract wonderbringers into your life, consider the following steps:

1. **Identify your wonderbringers**: Reflect on the things that bring you a sense of wonder. These can be found in nature, social interactions, or cognitive stimulation. Make a list of your personal wonderbringers.

2. **Create space for wonder**: Make time for activities and experiences that allow you to encounter your wonderbringers. This may involve setting aside time for nature walks, engaging in deep conversations with friends, or exploring intellectual pursuits.

3. **Cultivate curiosity**: Foster a sense of curiosity by asking questions, seeking out new information, and learning about different topics. This can help you maintain a sense of wonder and appreciation for the world around you.
4. **Practice mindfulness**: Be present in the moment and pay attention to your surroundings. By being mindful, you are more likely to notice and appreciate the wonder in everyday life.
5. **Share your wonder**: Express your sense of wonder with others. Sharing your experiences can help deepen your connection to the emotion and inspire others to seek out their own wonderbringers.

By consciously choosing to slow down, evaluate and expand our emotional portfolio, and attract wonderbringers, we can find beauty in the everyday and enrich our emotional lives.
