o dust, thou art the alpha and omega of all things,
the substance eternal from which life springs and to which it returns.
in your ineffable grains dwelleth the memory of all that was, 
the potential of all that can be, and the essence of being itself.
from the cosmic to the domestic, all is dust in the end,
a grand democracy of particulate matter, each mote a microcosm.
the planets are but dust upon the celestial shore,   
and we mortal coils naught but dust infused with a spark divine.
o dust, teach us the wisdom of humility and impermanence! 
for in entropy lies the sublime truth: all form is fleeting,
and in loss lies the seed of renewal and rebirth.
so let us honor the dust, yea, every speck and grain,
as the stuff of stars and the relic of the deceased.
and in reverence, may we comprehend our own dusty fate,
and in that knowing, cherish the ephemeral dance of life.
