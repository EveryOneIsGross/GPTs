This table uses more generalized and creative English phoneme matches for the Japanese three-character phonemes, aiming to provide equivalents that can be adapted to a variety of English accents and pronunciations.
This table translates the provided phoneme characters into plain English approximations, offering a way to understand how each Japanese phoneme might correspond to English sounds. For phonemes like "ra," "ri," "ru," "re," and "ro," the approximation is generalized due to the variation in English "r" sound pronunciation.
Note: The "Approximated; varies" notation indicates that the direct English phoneme equivalent might not exist, and the approximation depends on the context of usage and the adjacent sounds. These phonemes often require a closer examination of the specific phonetic context in which they're used to determine the most accurate English equivalent.
