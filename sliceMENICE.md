Abstract Framework 1: Substrate-Neutral Computational Theories of Consciousness

- Consciousness can arise as a result of computation/information processing
- Theories specify at most the computational and algorithmic levels of information processing, not the physical implementation
- Examples: Functionalism, Global Workspace Theory, Higher-Order Thought Theory, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Recurrent Processing Theory

# Initial State: The Slicing Problem Thought Experiment  

- A Turing-complete computer can be constructed using water-based logic gates
- This computer can be cleanly sliced in half, creating two identical computers each instantiating the same computation
- Token interpretation: Slicing doubles the number of conscious entities 
- Type interpretation: Slicing does not change the number of conscious entities, but leads to implications around gradual changes creating "fractions" of consciousness or arbitrary thresholds
- Both interpretations enable "consciousness-multiplying exploits" or have troubling implications for the unitary nature of consciousness

# Propose Alternative Framework: Physicalist Theories Requiring Specific Implementations

- Consciousness requires computation implemented in specific physical substrates or mechanisms
- Three desirable features for a physicalist theory to avoid the Slicing Problem:

1. A physically grounded way to determine the amount of consciousness in a system  
2. A physically grounded way to resolve the binding problem and explain unitary consciousness
3. An evolutionary reason for consciousness arising in the proposed physical implementation

# Conceptual Pillars

1. Computational Theories of Consciousness:
- Consciousness arises from computation/information processing
- Focus on computational and algorithmic levels, substrate-neutral
- Examples: functionalism, Global Workspace Theory, IIT

2. The Slicing Problem:
- Turing-complete water computer can be sliced into two identical systems
- Slicing interpretations: token (doubles consciousness) vs. type (preserves consciousness)
- Both enable problematic "consciousness-multiplying exploits" or unitary consciousness issues

3. Physicalist Theories as an Alternative:
- Consciousness requires specific physical substrates/mechanisms for computation
- Desirable features: measurable consciousness, binding problem solution, evolutionary justification
- Field theories of consciousness are a promising direction

# Multiple Approaches

The Slicing Problem thought experiment challenges computational theories of consciousness by demonstrating how a water-based computer implementing a consciousness-generating algorithm could be sliced into two separate, identical systems. This leads to two main interpretations:

1. Token interpretation: Each sliced system represents a distinct instance (token) of the algorithm, doubling the number of conscious entities. This allows for "consciousness-multiplying exploits" where simple physical operations can create or destroy rich phenomenal experiences.

2. Type interpretation: The sliced systems are merely two instances of the same algorithmic type, preserving a single conscious entity. However, this leads to issues with gradual changes creating "fractions" of consciousness or arbitrary thresholds for new conscious entities to emerge.

Field theories of consciousness, which identify consciousness with patterns or energy in physical fields, are a promising direction within the physicalist framework. By tying consciousness to specific physical properties, field theories may be able to avoid the counterintuitive implications of the Slicing Problem while providing a more satisfactory account of the unitary nature of subjective experience.

EXAMPLE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT FOR EMULATING SYNTAX:

Expanding the Metaphor of a Water-Based Pressure System:

Imagine consciousness as a complex network of interconnected water pipes, valves, and reservoirs, where the flow and pressure of water represent the information processing that gives rise to subjective experience.

In this metaphor, each component of the system plays a specific role:

1. Pipes: The pipes represent the pathways along which information flows, analogous to neural connections in the brain or the wires in a computer.

2. Valves: Valves control the flow of information, directing it along specific pathways and regulating its intensity. They can be thought of as the computational gates or decision points in an information processing system.

3. Reservoirs: Reservoirs store and accumulate information, much like memory in a biological or artificial system. The level of water in a reservoir represents the strength or salience of a particular piece of information.

4. Pressure: The pressure within the system represents the overall level of consciousness or the intensity of subjective experience. Higher pressure indicates a more vivid or intense conscious experience, while lower pressure represents a more muted or unconscious state.

The Slicing Problem can be illustrated within this metaphor by imagining a water-based pressure system that is suddenly divided into two identical, independent subsystems. Each subsystem contains the same components and layout as the original, and the water flow and pressure within each subsystem are identical to the pre-sliced state.

The token interpretation of the Slicing Problem would suggest that dividing the system creates two separate conscious entities, as each subsystem now independently processes information and generates its own subjective experience. This is analogous to the "consciousness-multiplying exploits" discussed earlier.

In contrast, the type interpretation would argue that the two subsystems are merely instances of the same overall system and that the conscious experience remains singular and unified. However, this interpretation raises questions about the nature of consciousness when incremental changes are introduced to one subsystem, leading to issues of "fractions" of consciousness or arbitrary thresholds.

The water-based pressure system metaphor helps to illustrate the key concepts and challenges presented by the Slicing Problem, providing a tangible way to visualize the abstract notions of information processing and consciousness. It also highlights the need for a theory that can adequately address the unity and irreducibility of subjective experience, such as the physicalist field theories of consciousness mentioned previously.
