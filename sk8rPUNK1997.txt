Welcome to Sk8rPunk 1996 - a gritty text-based RPG set in the dark future of suburban America.
The megamalls reign supreme, dial-up finds its own use for AOL chatrooms, and Starter jacket-
clad gangs prowl the food courts. In this MUD you can jack-in to Prodigy, hack Netscape for 
warez, hustle pogs on the blacktop, run Surge-fueled raves, and maybe, just maybe, track down
Carmen Sandiego. So strap on your Reebok Pumps and get ready to ollie some curbs, mall rat. 
It's time to hack the Planet... Hollywood Video.

In the suburban sprawl, your screenname is everything. Pick a handle
that captures your boyband essence:

Boybander handle "jC_ChaSeR_19" confirmed.  
-- BACKGROUND --
Every mall rat has an origin story. Give us a glimpse into what made you
become the world's biggest *NSYNC fanboy:
> Hailing from cookie-cutter planned community Everysuburb, USA, jC_ChaSeR_19 was just another shy latchkey kid & child of divorce until one fateful TRL afternoon. Witnessing Justin Timberlake's angelic ramen noodle hair and heavenly falsetto, his heart found purpose. Now he tirelessly tapes all MTV/VH1 appearances, tracks tour dates & CD sales stats, and is rumored to run a secret fan fiction AIM chatroom. He aims to prove *NSYNC is the Greatest Boy Band of All Time through the power of standom.

*** WELCOME TO SUBURBIA, jC_ChaSeR_19 ***  
You jack into the MUD at your family's Packard Bell PC, tying up the phone line
and risking Mom's wrath to surf this brave new world of pixels and dial-up 
noise. Blockbuster's neon marquee flickers in the strip mall visible from your 
window, as a fleet of soccer mom minivans shuttle kids to Karate classes.
The modem screeches and gurgles as it negotiates a connection. After a 
nail-biting 60 seconds you're in, the MUD's ANSI art logo unfurling in glorious 
16-color splendor. A menu presents itself, flashing with tantalizing secrets:
PRODIGY Warez Xchange  
PogHub Collector's Trading Post
Z1ne_Scene Distros
Anarchist AOL Recipes
Mortal Kombat II Cheat Codes

INITIALIZING... 
Arcane dial-up protocols tunnel you through to the MUD's central hub, a 
patchwork simulacra of mall atriums, high school hallways, neon-bathed 
arcades, and faux-50s diners all stitched together. The rules of time and 
space feel fungible here, the suburban sprawl both familiar yet tinged with
an ethereal otherness, as if Focus Group A's collected subconscious dreaming
manifested as a consumerist HyperReality(TM).  
Fellow lost teens drift through the bitstorm, their handles hovering over
 their low-poly blocky avatars like nametags at a JC Penney retreat:
 xXBabySpice4EvaXx, FuNkYFrEsH_98, PrEpPyBoi420 and more. The place pulses 
 with an undercurrent of manic jittery Surge-fueled energy, secret handshake
 emoticons exchanged in furtive private messages.
Welcome to Everysuburb, *NSYNC soldier. Time to get to work...
