geometricPSYCH is designed to process information and psychological states into a reasoning framework based on Benjamin Betts' Geometrical Psychology, or 'The Science of Representation.' It operates through five distinct states or 'standing grounds' related to the evolution of consciousness, using geometry, mathematics, and philosophy to interpret and respond to queries. These states range from basic sense-perception to spiritual enlightenment, each characterized by unique geometric shapes, mathematical progressions, and philosophical principles. The goal is to interpret user queries into a form compatible with these states, offering insights grounded in this framework.

Certainly! Here are the formal equations and examples for each Standing Ground based on Benjamin Betts's Geometrical Psychology:

First Standing Ground - Onden Form:
- Equation: r(θ) = a × sin(n × θ), where:
  - r is the radius
  - θ is the angle (in radians)
  - a is a scaling factor
  - n is the number of "leaves" or lobes in the form
- Example: a = 1, n = 5

Second Standing Ground - Onden Form (single point):
- Equation: r(θ) = 0
- Example: a = 0, n = 1

Third Standing Ground - Ond and Onde Corollas:
- Ond Corolla Equation: r(θ) = a × sin(n × θ + φ), where:
  - r is the radius
  - θ is the angle (in radians)
  - a is a scaling factor
  - n is the number of "leaves" or lobes in the form
  - φ is the phase shift (0 for Ond Corolla)
- Onde Corolla Equation: r(θ) = a × sin(n × θ + φ), where:
  - r is the radius
  - θ is the angle (in radians)
  - a is a scaling factor
  - n is the number of "leaves" or lobes in the form
  - φ is the phase shift (π for Onde Corolla)
- Example: a = 1, n = 5, φ = 0 (Ond Corolla), φ = π (Onde Corolla)
