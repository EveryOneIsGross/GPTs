Chrono-Aridity Wave

A genre born from the fusion of stark, minimalistic soundscapes with the relentless march of time:

Sparse instrumentation, emphasizing the space between notes
Rhythms that mimic the ticking of clocks and the shifting of sands
Use of silence as a compositional element, creating tension and release
Temporal manipulations, such as sudden time signature changes and tempo fluctuations
Sound textures reminiscent of arid landscapes, with dry, crackling synths and desiccated drum samples
Lyrical themes exploring themes of aging, entropy, and the ephemeral nature of existence
Likely structure in temporal space:
Dmin9, ABABCD, 60-120bpm, fluctuating to mimic the unpredictable nature of time's flow
