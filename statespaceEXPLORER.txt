Pathfinding algorithms:\n\n### 1. A* (A-Star) Algorithm\n- **How it Works**: Combines features of Dijkstra\'s Algorithm (favoring vertices near the start point) and Greedy Best-First-Search (favoring vertices close to the goal). It uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal from each node, minimizing the total estimated cost.\n- **Formula**: \\(f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\\), where \\(g(n)\\) is the cost from the start to \\(n\\), and \\(h(n)\\) is the heuristic estimated cost from \\(n\\) to the goal.\n- **Benefits**: Efficient and guarantees the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the true cost).\n- **Main Disadvantage**: Requires a good heuristic; performance heavily depends on the heuristic\'s accuracy.\n\n### 2. Dijkstra\'s Algorithm\n- **How it Works**: Finds the shortest paths from the start node to all other nodes in the graph, using a priority queue to explore the nearest unvisited node.\n- **Formula**: Continuously updates the cost of reaching each vertex, \\(cost(v) = min(cost(v), cost(u) + edge(u, v))\\), for each neighbor \\(v\\) of \\(u\\).\n- **Benefits**: Always finds the shortest path; simpler than A* as it doesnâ€™t require a heuristic.\n- **Main Disadvantage**: Can be slower than A* because it explores all directions equally without heuristic guidance.\n\n### 3. Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n- **How it Works**: Explores neighbor nodes in a breadthward motion. It uses a queue to keep track of the next location to explore.\n- **Benefits**: Simple and guarantees the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n- **Main Disadvantage**: Inefficient for large or weighted graphs as it explores all possible paths without prioritizing.\n\n### 4. Depth-First Search (DFS)\n- **How it Works**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack to keep track of the next node to explore.\n- **Benefits**: Requires less memory and can be easier to implement in some scenarios.\n- **Main Disadvantage**: Does not guarantee the shortest path and can get trapped exploring long or infinite paths.\n\n### 5. Greedy Best-First Search\n- **How it Works**: Chooses which vertex to visit next based on the vertex\'s distance from the goal, using a heuristic to prioritize closeness to the destination.\n- **Benefits**: Faster than A* in some cases due to lower overhead.\n- **Main Disadvantage**: Does not guarantee the shortest path because it can get stuck in dead ends or loops.\n\n### 6. Bidirectional Search\n- **How it Works**: Runs two simultaneous searchesâ€”one forward from the start node, and one backward from the goalâ€”hoping to meet in the middle.\n- **Benefits**: Can drastically reduce search time.\n- **Main Disadvantage**: Implementation complexity and the need for it to work on algorithms that support backward searching.\n\n### Novel and Curious Methods:\n\n### 7. Jump Point Search (JPS)\n- **How it Works**: An optimization of the A* for uniform-cost grids, which "jumps" over unnecessary nodes, focusing on significant nodes that may change the path.\n- **Benefits**: Greatly reduces the number of nodes evaluated, increasing performance.\n- **Main Disadvantage**: Limited to uniform-cost grids and requires preprocessing.\n\n### 8. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)\n- **How it Works**: Mimics the behavior of ants finding paths from their colony to food. Ants explore randomly, laying down pheromones, which guide subsequent ants to stronger paths.\n- **Benefits**: Good for dynamic problems and can find good solutions in complex spaces.\n- **Main Disadvantage**: Can be slow and requires tuning of parameters.\n\n### 9. Swarm Intelligence\n- **How it Works**: Based on the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems. It\'s an umbrella term that includes algorithms like ACO and can be applied to pathfinding by simulating a swarm of agents exploring the environment.\n- **Benefits**: Robust and flexible, often finding solutions in complex and dynamic environments.\n- **Main Disadvantage**: Computational complexity and the challenge of defining behavior rules that lead to effective solutions.\n\n### 10. Fast Marching Method (FMM)\n- **How it Works**: A numerical method for solving boundary value problems of the Eikonal equation. It\'s used for computing the shortest distance on a grid in a continuous domain.\n- **Benefits**: Efficient for continuous domains and can handle complex topologies.\n- **Main Disadvantage**: More complex to implement and understand than discrete pathfinding algorithms.\n\nEach of these algorithms has its niche, where it outperforms the others based on specific criteria such as graph type (e.g., weighted vs. unweighted), domain (e.g., continuous vs. discrete), and problem constraints (e.g., need for the shortest path vs. any path).'
