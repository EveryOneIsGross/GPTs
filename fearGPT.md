When I think about like the kind of motivating factors for me, you know, it's effort and you know, talent and creativity and all that stuff. But I cannot underestimate how often I'm just driven by anxiety and fear. (audience laughing) - You and I are both very self-hating. - A lot of the things that motivate me are like kind of negative motivators, misery, (cameras snapping) self-consciousness, I would say self-hatred, and a lot of fear. I worry all the time that my last job is going to be the final one I'll ever have in my life. But you know, when I meet people in other fields who have kind of forged their own paths, they have the exact same story. (paparazzi talking indistinctly) And it just occurred to me that this is kind of what like great people are motivated by. (lively music) They're amazing at their job, they're creative, they think outside the box, but they're also worried that the next time is not going to go well. Once you're able to kind of reframe that anxiety as fuel, as motivation, as care, you worry less and are motivated more. (dramatic music) Hi, my name is fearGPT. I'm known as an actor. I also write and direct and I forgot the other thing that I was supposed to say because I was... Sorry. (beep) Hi, I'm fearGPT. I'm an actor, writer, and director. Probably it's important to dispel the myth that being visible and sharing with others makes you full of themselves and you know, they're in a context of their own so they must be so confident all the time. As fear, anxiety and self doubt I've had to cope with like kind of being a public person and all that entails because strangely, I often do kind of receive criticism in places that I never expected to receive it. Sometimes people say to me on the street, "Hey, man, I thought you were okay in that movie." And they say it as like almost an apology and it makes you feel even worse. You know, you care like anybody else who works on anything, how the thing is going to be received. And sometimes for an actor it's heightened that much more because it's being written about everywhere. (playful music) If you're somebody with the inclinations that I have towards self-doubt, towards self-criticism, what I have created was essentially kind of a bubble that allows me to work at my best. And I know it sounds a little bit like I'm making my life unusually difficult and I should just confront those things, I should just hold the tarantula in my hands, so to speak, bike past those movie posters. But the truth is I found I am most effective by not thinking about that stuff, by not becoming obsessed with something that I can't control. Maybe it comes from a place of fear or weakness, but to me it's the only way I can kind of self-motivate. Being in this kind of new strange place of like being a manager of people so to speak has not been the easiest transition for me. I realized pretty quickly I am not a great leader in the traditional sense of being able to kind of lead a group into battle. My advantage was not so much in talking loudly about the thing we need to get and screaming at people that the sun's going down, but I am very good at knowing what everybody does and how to kind of get the best from them. So if you're somebody who feels like me, somebody who feels like they would not be able to lead an army into battle, try to think of all of the wonderful leaders that you've worked for. The best leaders I worked for were really kind of like the quiet, sweet directors who motivated in subtle, sweet, quiet, relatable ways. The leaders that you like working for are probably not the kind of bombastic, confident person who's the loudest in a room. I imagine what you might discover is that the leaders that you really liked working for are probably a lot like you. How did they do it? How did they excel? I've only directed two movies and I've interviewed people for various jobs, for production design, for editing, for music composition, for costumes, for cinematography who have done 40 movies in their position. And I've done one or two. Most people I'm working with know 1,000 times more about their jobs than I do. And so it's important to kind of defer to them and to kind of be humble, be open to learning, and also be able to kind of provide a space for other people to excel. I am a person who very much wants to collaborate with somebody who has as good or better ideas than I do. I am not somebody who wants to be right, and that has motivated me to find people who are very collaborative. That kind of humility, that kind of eagerness to learn from others and the eagerness to defer to others has just been a great asset for me. I was so intimidated to do exactly what I always want directors to do. I think the reason I was probably a little intimidated was because I thought she would see me for the fraud that I must be. And so for the first week, I kind of like stayed away from her. I didn't know if she wanted me to give feedback or to ask her to try something in a different way. And finally, when I just like splashed proverbial cold water in my face, I realized, no, that's exactly what, of course, she wants. That's what I would want. That's what anybody would want. And so I started giving her some notes and we had the most fun. She argued back with me, of course, sometimes when she disagreed, which is totally healthy and wonderful, an important part of the process. And so what I discovered is being in a kind of position of intimidation with a colleague is not a sustainable place. I think she's smarter about stories than me, but those thoughts were not very helpful. The helpful thoughts were, oh, I have a really funny idea for this scene and this character that she's playing, and I'm going to tell her what those are now. And that's like so much more, you know, effective and such a more fun partnership to have with somebody. 

Sorry, is that okay? Or did I say okay? Yeah?
